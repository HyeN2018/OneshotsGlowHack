This project is created to help starters`(not pros & whoever comes in between)` to get up to speed with the high skill level required in online server matches against human players.

NOTE : The method used in this app is 100% VAC proof(tested myself on multiple servers). But still, use it at your own risk.

Release download : click [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/gmastergreatee/oneshotsglowhack/build/artifacts)

And no, __Aimbot__ will not be integrated as `wall-hack` must be enough for starters

Make sure to run the hack with __"admin"__ privileges for it to work correctly.

## Steps to update the hack yourself

Please follow the given steps to update the hack(after csgo update) :-

1. Run "csgo.exe", connect to an online server & join a team.
2. Run "HazeDumper.exe" with admin priviledges.
3. After you see some offsets in the console, close the HazeDumper console.

Done, the hack is updated.
