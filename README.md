# OneshotsGlowHack
GlowHack for CSGO
- core programming by [OneShot](https://github.com/OneshotGH)
- menu options by [gmastergreatee](https://github.com/gmastergreatee)

This project is created to help starters`(not pros & whoever comes in between)` to get up to speed with the high skill level required in online server matches against human players.

NOTE : The method used in this app is 100% VAC proof(tested myself on multiple servers). But still, use it at your own risk.

Release download__(Update 20 Dec, 2017)__ : https://openload.co/f/K1GlDU8L3BE/OneshotsGlowHack.exe

And no, __Aimbot__ will not be integrated as `wall-hack` must be enough for starters
